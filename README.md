# OpenStreetMap
I analyzed data from OpenStreetMap to gain insights in the Greater Salt Lake City metropolitan area.

I kept the answers to these questions in mind as I performed my data auditing and cleaning:

1. Does the code function as expected?

2. Does project utilize good coding practices?

3. Is the code commented in a way that is useful and not superfluous?

4. Does the project document the challenges encountered during the wrangling?

5. Is data cleaned programmatically?

6. Is the OSM XML large enough?

7. Are overview statistics of the dataset computed?

8. Are the database queries documented?

9. Are ideas for additional improvements included?

10. Are benefits and problems with additional improvements discussed?

11. Is the submission long enough to answer the questions?
